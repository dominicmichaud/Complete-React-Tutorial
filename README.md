# Complete-React-Tutorial

All course files for the Complete React Tutorial on the Net Ninja YouTube channel. Forked from Net Ninja's repo.

Using the concepts learned in the course, I fused them with my own React knowledge to bring the tutorial to the next level. I added animations and UI libs to make the site more alive and provide user feedbacks on actions or errors. Also added a WYSIWYG Rich Text Editor for the blog text and Form validations on submit. All of this is outside the scope of the tutorial of course, but a nice challenge for acquiring new React knowledge.
